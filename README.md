# Harmonica
Harmonica may have started as a simple practice project, but it represents the beginning of my journey in web development. It was a fun, easy-peasy way to put my skills to the test and learn by doing. Iâ€™m looking forward to sharing more projects and connecting with this amazing community as I continue to grow.
